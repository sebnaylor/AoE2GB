## Features

- Players who've started a game in the last 30mins
- In progress and recently completed matches showing civilisation, Elo, map, server and player nationalities
- 1v1 Elo leaderboard


## Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript



## Lessons Learned

- When designing a component and using data as a reference, use non homogenous data
- When creating figma designs, sketch out how it would be implemented in html and use that as a feedback loop before starting coding
- Complete the figma design in full before starting coding. Extra time at the start will cut time spent later refactoring a design for the 2nd or 3rd time
- It was satisfying using vanilla JavaScript but libraries will be helpful in refactoring this in the future


## Roadmap

- Steam sign on 
- Chatroom
- Current spectators tag
